# emacs-descriptors
What is everything in emacs and spacemacs?! There are so many terms for newbies, each term should have a simple description of function. This was created for my own reference purposes, but I hope it helps others! I had previous Vi(m) experience, but I hope this is usable for everybody.

emacs: An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor â€” and more.
